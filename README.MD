## React Native Template Repo - Eric Lantz

This is a template repo that contains a default React Native project using Expo **with additional useful elements.**

---

Once you have created your own repo from the template and are in your IDE, you can <span style="color:green">**Run**</span> the app by typing the following in the terminal:

`expo start`

## Template Features

### **File Structure:**

_Everything in bold is added past the original `create-expo` file structure._

### **Components**

Added 4 components with general formatting that allow for starting the UI of the app more easily!

The **`screens`** folder contains a file called _ComponentExamples.js_ which is the screen that will be displayed when you start the application (done by typing `expo start` into the terminal).

In _ComponentExamples.js_, there are visual usages of all 4 of the additional components I created so it is easier to identify what they do and how they do it. The components in this file are calls of the components that are setup in the **`components`** folder in the file structure.

### **React Native Functional Component Snippet**

I also created an additional component in the components folder called rnfc (React Native Functional Component) that contains the structure to create a component script. You can copy the contents of this file and create a new snippet using it and it will contain all the structural elements needed for a component.

> The only thing needed to be changed when copying the code is you should have the component's function name match the name of the component you put in the file tree.

_I was going to use a code snippet that could be downloaded, but not everyone uses Visual Studio Code and I figured this would be easier than having to learn how to import code snippets if you ddidn't know how anyway!_
